AND101 Project 7 - CYOAPI Part 3: Beautified

Submitted by: Tony Logan

Time spent: X hours spent in total

Summary

Cozy Creature Catalog is an Android app that displays a scrollable list of cute, fictional creatures using a RecyclerView. Each creature card shows the creature’s name, type, and a short fun fact, using custom styling, a downloadable font, and a modified app theme.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 🦊✨📱

Notes

This project helped me strengthen my understanding of RecyclerView, adapters, view binding, and UI styling in Android. I also learned how small XML mistakes (like missing layout_width/height) can cause app crashes and how to debug LayoutInflater errors using Logcat.
